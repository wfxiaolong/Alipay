**QR Code**

Quick Response Code (QR Code) consists of black squares arranged in a square grid on a white background, which can be read by an imaging device and processed. The required data are then extracted from patterns that are present in both horizontal and vertical components of the image, as depicted below.

In this Merchant QR Code payment solution, a merchant can use a static QR Code to represent their cashier account.

**Interface**

In this context, the interface is the channel that the Alipay system provides the relevant service by invoking the corresponding APIs with the required parameter values. Throughout this guide, we may use interface and serive interchangeably.
