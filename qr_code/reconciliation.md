## SFTP Connection

The Alipay system has implemented the White List mechanism, and the partner needs to notify Alipay of its public IPs. Then, we will release a username together with password to the partner to test the accessibility and reconciliation file parsing/cron job. If these testings are successful, the partner can push the system to the production.

Alternatively, the partner also can manually access the merchantâ€™s dashboard to download the reconciliation and settlement report, using the the information of below:

URL: https://global.alipay.com

Username: **testoverseas1980@alipay.com** 

Password: **testoverseas1980**

Alipay SFTP Server: **sftp.alipay.com/port:22**

Alipay SFTP Server IP: **110.75.149.86**

The file naming rule is:

1. $PID_transaction_$YYYYMMDD.txt;
2. $PID_settlement_$YYYYMMDD.txt
